		About Me
	</h1>
	<p>
		
		Born in the Philippines, a beautiful tropical archipelago between Taiwan and Malaysia.

		I love adventure. 
		I've been hiking all over the Philippines from an early age.

		<br>
		I've been kayaking, diving, cliff jumping, mountain biking, and I've even trekked across Japan.
		<br>
		But what I love most is chilling at the beach with a stomach full of grilled seafood and an ice cold beer in my hand.

		Not Corona but you get the point.
		Thats about it. I'm a simple dude.

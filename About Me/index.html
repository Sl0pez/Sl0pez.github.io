		Philippines: The Places I've Been to

	<br>

	<h3>
		<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/philippines/palawan" target="_blank">Palawan</a>
	</h3>

	<hr>

	<p>
		One of the best beaches and islands in Philipines. I've been here a couple of times to different parts of the main island but every part is equally beautiful. Palawan is made up of one main island and a scattering of other islands around it. Each island is different and offers unique experiences such as specific schools of fish, coral structures, even an underground river. The one thing all the islands have in common is pristine white sand beaches. My favorite spot in Palawan is a resort in Coron called the <a href="http://twoseasonsresorts.com/coron/" target="_blank">Two Seasons</a>. It is located on a small narrow albeit long island that is situated in a large cove of sorts, surrounded by much bigger islands. The gem of the resort isn't the resort itself but the coral reefs in and around the area as well as the amazing fresh seafood they bring in everyday. When I die, I'll pass on heaven and go straight to Two Seasons.

		<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/philippines/mindanao/siargao" target="_blank">Siargao</a>
	</h3>

	<hr>

	<p>
		I don't have a favorite place in Siargo &lpar;shar-gow&rpar; because pretty much the entire area is amazing. It is known mainly for its surfing in the infamous <a href="http://magicseaweed.com/Cloud-9-Surf-Guide/637/" target="_blank">Cloud 9</a> but rest assured, pretty much like every other beach in the Philippines, Siargao is filled with amazing reefs and wildlife. One of my best memories growing up was waking up early and walking out half a mile when the tide was low, looking for colorful starfish, small fish, crabs, and other bottom dwellers that you normally have to dive for. Siargao is a magical place.

		<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/philippines/the-visayas/bohol" target="_blank">Bohol</a>
	</h3>

	<hr>

	<p>
		Although it has plenty of nice beaches, Bohol is mainly known for its <a href="http://www.chocolatehills.net/" target="_blank">chocolate hills</a> and <a href="http://www.tarsiusproject.org/philippine-tarsiers/" target="_blank">tarsiers</a>. The chocolate hills are a group of about 1200&plus; hills that go no more than 120 meters in height. The name refers to the similarity of colors when summer comes around and the grass turns brown. I had a lot of fun exploring this surreal landscape on ATVs, racing from hill to hill. Tarsiers are cute tiny primates with large eyes that make them look like Yoda. There are preserves around Bohol where tourists go to view these curious little creatures. However, the most fun I had in Bohol was in the <a href="https://bohol-beach-resorts.com/loboc-ecotourism-adventure-park/" target="_blank">Loboc Ecotourism Adventure Park</a> where they had a superman style &lpar;basically ziplining on your belly facing down&rpar; zipline that goes across a gorge. It is a thrill ride to see the ground beneath you just drop away into a river but at the same time it is breathtaking seeing a water fall to your right and the forest to your left.

		<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/philippines/tagaytay-lake-taal" target="_blank">Tagaytay</a>
	</h3>

	<hr>

	<p>
		Tagaytay is known for being on the ridge surrounding a lake with a volcano at the center. I've heard some people say that Tagaytay is itself a large volcano but I'm not sure if that is actually true. There are tons of restaurants around the ridge that have amazing high views of the lake. The volcano at the center is a tourist attraction on its own. I've taken a small boat to the volcano and hike up to the top and gone down into the center of the volcano. Standing on the ridge of the volcano and looking up to see another much larger ridge around is seriously a huge mindfuck. While the restaurants are great and the hike is an amazing experience, what I remember most about Tagaytay is the <a href="http://www.tlyc.com/boat-rentals/" target="_blank">sailing</a>. I learned to sail on toppers &lpar;small one person sailboats&rpar; and the winds actually pick up at certain times of the day, so much so that they often hold races on the lake.

		<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/philippines/olongapo-subic-bay" target="_blank">Subic</a>
	</h3>

	<hr>

	<p>
		Subic Bay is the hub of most export and imports of goods to and from international countries however Subic is sort of a jack of all trades. It has a number of nature and park <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g4751237-Activities-c57-Subic_Bay_Freeport_Zone_Central_Luzon_Region_Luzon.html" target="_blank">attractions</a> ranging from a safari, to a nature trail, to even a <a href="http://www.treetopadventureph.com/" target="_blank">Tree Top Adventure</a> and an <a href="http://www.ourawesomeplanet.com/awesome/2013/07/ocean-adventure-subic.html" target="_blank">Ocean Adventure</a>, a ocean theme park where you can play around with dolphins and other trained animals. Subic has some amazing beaches as well, about 30 minutes from the main bay where we stay for the day, grilling food and swimming in the shallows.
